# Mahdi Babaei
## B.Sc. - Electrical Engineering - Sharif University of Technology

I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2023. Since then, I have been an **independent researcher** and am currently working as a remote intern at the University of British Columbia. My project aims to identify the most effective electrical vestibular stimulation for Parkinson's patients to enhance behavioral metrics, such as motor vigor and response time, using a weakly supervised approach.

You can click on the [Projects](./projects.md) page to see the details of my work.

Additionally, here is my four-page [CV](/MahdiBabaei_CV.pdf).

### Research Interests
I have worked in various fields, and my research interests are diverse:
1. **Signal Processing (with a focus on biosignals)**
2. **Computational Neuroscience** 
3. **Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**

I am also interested in the field of **Computer Vision**. Given my solid background in mathematics and programming, I am confident that I will be able to grasp the basics of this field without difficulty.

### English Language Proficiency
I hold a TOEFL score of **100** from the exam I took last year. With multiple internship positions and meetings, my English proficiency has further improved beyond that score.
