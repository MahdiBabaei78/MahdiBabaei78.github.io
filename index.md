# Mahdi Babaei
## B.Sc. - Electrical Engineering - Sharif University of Technology

I graduated with a degree in **Electrical Engineering** from **Sharif University of Technology**, Iran, in 2023. Since then, I have been an **independent researcher** and am currently working as a remote intern at the **University of British Columbia**. My ongoing project aims to identify the most effective electrical vestibular stimulation for Parkinson's patients to enhance behavioral metrics, such as motor vigor and response time, using a weakly supervised approach.

Moreover, I have recently submitted one of my papers under the title of **"Variability in Brain Responses to Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation: A Granger Causality Analysis of Independent Components in Resting-State EEG"** to the **Brain Stimulation Conference**. 

You can click on the [Projects](./projects.md) page to see the details of my other works.

Additionally, here is my four-page [CV](/MahdiBabaei_CV.pdf).

### Research Interests
I have worked in various fields, and my research interests are diverse:
1. **Signal and Image Processing (with a focus on biosignals and medical images)**
2. **Computational Neuroscience** 
3. **Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**

I am also interested in the field of **Computer Vision**. Given my solid background in mathematics and programming, I am confident that I will be able to grasp the basics of this field without difficulty.

### English Language Proficiency
I hold a TOEFL score of **100** from the exam I took last year. With multiple internship positions and meetings, my English proficiency has further improved beyond that score.

### Publications
I am currently working on various projects and this section will be updated soon. Until now, here is a list of my publications:
